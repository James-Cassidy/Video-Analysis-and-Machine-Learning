# Video Analysis and Machine Learning Project

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a machine learning-based object detection system designed to detect people within a dataset of over 4,000 images. The system applies computer vision techniques and supervised learning to identify and classify individuals across diverse environments and lighting conditions.

The main goal of this project was to explore the application of machine learning algorithms in video analysis, emphasizing object detection and tracking for real-world use cases such as surveillance, crowd monitoring, and automated analytics.
